Dear Ms Adams,

I am writing to express my dismay at the delivery and customer service.

I havent receive my purchase in 48 hours as it was described on the site. I am dissatisfied with a customer service too.

I hope you can take steps to make sure that I get my purchase in a day or two.

Yours faithfully, [yours sincirely]
