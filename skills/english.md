Dear Ms Adams,

I am writing to express my dismay at the delivery and customer service.

I havent receive my purchase in 48 hours as it was described on the site. I am dissatisfied with a customer service too.

I hope you can take steps to make sure that I get my purchase in a day or two.

Yours faithfully, [yours sincirely]

# 0 Conditional

This conditional is used when the result will always happen. So, if water reaches 100 degrees,

**If/When + present simple, .... present simple.**

* If people eat too much, they get fat.

# 1st conditional

It's used to talk about things which might happen in the future. 
Of course, we can't know what will happen in the future,
but this describes possible things, which could easily come true.

**if + present simple, ... will + infinitive**

* If it rains, I won't go to the park.
* If I study today, I'll go to the party tonight.
* If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes.
* She'll be late if the train is delayed.

# 2nd conditional

**if + past simple, ...would + infinitive**

First, we can use it to talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true. 
Maybe I'm imagining some dream for example.

* If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.(I probably won't win the lottery)
* If I met the Queen of England, I would say hello.
* She would travel all over the world if she were rich.
* She would pass the exam if she ever studied.(She never studies, so this won't happen)

Second, we can use it to talk about something in the present which is impossible,
because it's not true.

* If I had his number, I would call him. (I don't have his number now, so it's impossible for me to call him).
* If I were you, I wouldn't go out with that man.

----

# 3nd conditional (past action)

It talks about the past. It's used to describe a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation.

**if + past perfect, ...would + have + past participle**

* If he hadn't drank a lot of beer yesterday, he wouldn't have missed the train
* If he hadn't broken up with his girlfrend, wouldn't have been so upset yesterday
* if Max hadn't hepled me with the logs I wouldn't [ha]ve resolved the issue
* if Leitenant hadn't missed the documents I wouldn't [ha]ve escape the army that year
* if my teacher hadn't missed the documents I wouldn't [ha]ve known how a broken promise fills like
