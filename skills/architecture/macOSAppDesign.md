Recommended reading materials.

Developing modern macOS applications (i.e. macOS Catalina+) requires developers have intimate knowledge of the XNU Kernel, DarwinOS, SwiftUI, System Extensions, and XPC Services. The below links will prove useful in understanding these fundamental technologies.

## OS Internals Volumns 1 - 3:  <http://newosxbook.com/index.php>

These books cover a wide array of topics all squarely focused on XNU, Darwin, and its deviates. You’ll learn the mach kernel, the BSD layer, Userland services such as: Spotlight, launchD, XPC, threads, GCD, Kernel Extensions, System Extensions, UNIX, etc. These are must reads.

## Apple IPC: <https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484270448>

This book covers the wide variety of XPC Services on macOS. Starting with the low level mach & BSD APIs through to NSXPCConnection in Swift. This book focuses on teaching the fundamental services needed to  architect modular XPC apps. You’ll also learn how to broadcast a system XPC Service.

## macOS Daemonology: <https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781484272763>
