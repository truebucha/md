In case you as a company employee located in Belarus couldn’t make a doctor appointment the first day due to pandemic
chaos reasons (which means you attempted to get to doctor but the attempt wasn’t successful)
and you don’t have medical certificate paper for this day - you have ability to request for sick 
leave for this day via Group Manager given that you still get to the doctor eventually (like the next day)
and get the certificate. You are expected to notify your Group Manager as soon as you realize you might not be able to make to the doctor today.
Group Manager has authority to reject such request if he/she has a solid reason. Group Manager may consider double checking information with project(s)
leads/managers if it makes sense to. Then Group Manager creates the Extended Sick Leave 
Help Desk ticket and specifies the absence date(s) to update prior to the medical cert start date.
This ideally should happen the same day Group Manager got notified by group member. 
After this’s done accountants make changes in RMSys accordingly for the date(s) in issue.
If Group Manager for some reason isn’t responsive and cant' help - reach out to Department Manager for the request.
Note that this doesn’t work in the following cases:
* You don’t get the medical certificate paper confirming your diagnosis within next day or two. 
* If that happens you have to compensate the non-working hours later or the day(s) are considered as vacation.
* You are out of your 10 sick days a year. In that the non-working day(s) are considered as vacation.
