Hi all,
 
I am very happy to share some good news as my first message to you all!
 
As you know to this day, we were covering the costs of documentation preparation and translation costs and helping with legal giudance for people willing to relocate from Belarus to other offices of our company. Listening to your feedback, we hear that there are quite substancial other expenses experienced during or right after relocation, such as transport costs, family transfer related costs, accomodation during self-isolation costs etc.
As a company, we are commited to support employees in this transition so we decided to implement a one-off Relocation costs re-imbursement payment, of 1500 USD, that will be paid in cash by and will hopefully cover most of the added costs and help the adaptation.
All relocating employees will be eligible for the re-imbursement ‚Äì the relocated previously and those planing to relocate in the future.
 
Please include the following to your next invoice as a separate line item as follows: Name of article or service = IT services/Us≈Çugi programistyczne; Amount = 1; Unit = Relocation. 
With the usual taxes added, the amount should be 1705 USD (1500 Reimbursement / 0.88). 
 
Also, using the same opportunity, I would like to give you a small update regarding the entity in Poland. We are in process of getting all the necessary artefacts to allow us to sing the contracts with you and once it‚Äôs ready ‚Äì I will surely let you know. In the meanwhile, we are speaking with lawyers regarding tax and migration matters in order to help you setting up in the country. It looks like the migration laws are very complex and in order to know the necessary steps, we need to look into each case separately. Therefore, I would like  to ask you to respond to me individually on the following questions:
On what bases are you currently in Poland (i.e. Karta Polaka, marriage etc.)?
How long till your current residence permit expires?
Are you planning to apply for the residence permit (temp or permanent) and for how long?
Any specific needs for legal help or tax guidance at this point?
Knowing your situation regarding the questions above will help us to better prioritize and arrange the legal support and guidance on specifics (like health insurance requirements etc.) so it would be great if you could come back to me as soon as possible.
